# HyperMorpion

### Description

HyperMorpion is a *mini-games* Discord bot originally created to implement the game of "hyper tic-tac-toe", a much more complex and ~~hard~~ fun version of Tic-tac-toe. 
It comes with French and English translations so far (people may help adding a new one in the future) and allows you to play HyperMorpion, Tic-tac-toe, and maybe other games in the future!


### Creation

This bot has been created from scratch by myself with the **discord.js**, **canvas** and **gifencoder** modules of **Node.js**.
